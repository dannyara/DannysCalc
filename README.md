# DannysCalc


This is my first solo programming project on Java. This application runs a simple yet functional calculator mini-app on the desktop. The idea is to have this application be easy and quick to use, be intuitive and most of all be costumizable and easy to impliment newer add-on features

<p>
<i> Future release: </i> <b>
In the future, I plan to add scientific calculator features, such as sin,cos,tan, logritmic calculations, factorials, and other add-ons as needed. I am also planning to have a "sidebar" which displays history of equations and numbers used.
<p>
<b>How to: </b>
To run, clone 2018 Release and run the Driver.java to open the gui, or run the Java executable.
