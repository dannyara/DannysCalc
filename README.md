# DannysCalc
This is my first solo programming project on Java
calc.java  is a simple key input based program that takes in numbers from the keyboard and operators (seperated by spaces) and outputs solution
calcView is the main focus as it is a full gui program to mimic a basic functioning calculator, also supports number inputs from the keyboard
